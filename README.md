For setting up AlphaCrowd continuous integration server, use the Dockerfile in this repo and follow instructions here:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-perform-continuous-integration-testing-with-drone-io-on-coreos-and-docker

TODO:
Put instructions in link above in this README directly instead of relying on external link
Find a way of getting secret key out of Dockerfile
Implement backing up of database to S3 for instance and a way of pulling it upon install (run).
